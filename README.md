# OperationCheckmate

Operation Checkmate is a semesterly project the support team takes on. This operation requires the support team to manually 'touch' every course in the LMS to turn off
two settings so the course would function with the university database management system.

This project was a two-month endeavor to automate this process to reduce the load the support team had to undertake. 
Every step is explained in the code example. I have taken out identifying information specific to making it run on my machine, but the libraries I used and the steps taken remain.
